 After a long hiatus I have finally decided to open the doors for this project to be open source. I have been getting lot of inquiries about the status of the project but thought that it wouldn't be fair since the project has not been updated over an year to sell it. Therefore, I am officially making it open source to let anyone who is interested in using it for their commercial/non-commercial use to be completely free.

I will be working on the project moving forward on my free time. If you utilize my project to create something of your own I would be interested to see how you guys make out.
